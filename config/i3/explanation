I created the ~/.local/bin directory and added some scripts there.  Then, I edited 
my ~/.zshrc file to add that directory to my PATH$ definition.

The purpose was so that these scripts could run from anywhere for my user.  Which 
means that programs like rofi (or dmenu) could run them.  I could call these scripts 
from within my ~/.config/i3/config file, for power manage  ment.

I found out how to add directories to my $PATH from stack overflow:

I got to the YT video from a DDG search:
