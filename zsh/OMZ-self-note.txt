The following are the custom plugins I use for ZSH, and where to get them:

[01] auto-suggestions
>install via Arch repo  -OR-
>manual install: https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/blob/master/INSTALL.md

[02] syntax-highlighting
>install via Arch repo  -OR-
>manual install: https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/INSTALL.md

[03] autojump
>manual install only: https://github.com/wting/autojump
    [need to be in the "~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins" directory, then run the git clone]

[04] auto-ls
> manual install only: https://github.com/desyncr/auto-ls
    [NOTE: I have not been able to get this one working]
